module krepel.math;

// NOTE(Manu): @Marvin
// Create your <whatever>.d files within this folder and add the line `module
// krepel.math.<whatever>` at the top of them. That line is optional but I
// think it's nice to have it there. Within this file (math/package.d), you
// can then add `public import krepel.math.<whatever>;`, so people only need
// to say `import krepel.math;` and they will have everything they need.
